***Value:*** `=this.TraitValue`
***Types:*** `=this.TraitType`
***Prerequisites:*** `=this.TraitPrereqs`
***Description:***

Champions have a powerful potential to both attack and defend. They are reliant on their weapons and armor, and have diverse options to utilize them. This trait is an [[Archetype Traits|Archetype Trait]], so much of its value is in opening up other trait options.

You have a pool of dice called Champion Dice. Your pool begins with 1d8. You regain all used dice from your pool whenever you take a [[Refresh]]. These have no innate purpose, but fuel many of this Archetype's other traits.
