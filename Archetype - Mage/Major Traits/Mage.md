***Description:***

Mages are versatile and powerful spellcasters. They use a wide array of options with which to use their magic, and can learn arcane secrets about the world. This trait is an [[Archetype Traits|Archetype Trait]], so much of its value is in opening up other trait options.

When you take a [[Rest Period]] or [[Recovery Period]], you regain all of your Mana. Major Traits can't allow you to regain Mana during a [[Refresh]].
