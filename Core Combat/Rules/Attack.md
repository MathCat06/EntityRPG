To make an attack, first select a [[Weapon]] you have access to. Then, select a target within its reach. Next, roll the Check associated with the Weapon (make sure to add [[Defense Modifiers]] from the target). If the check is successful, roll the weapon's Damage and deal it to the target. Unless otherwise specified, [[Damage]] reduces Break Endurance first, then once a target is [[Broken]], the target's Body Endurance.
