In order to craft an [[Item]], a creature requires a [[Traits|Trait]] or another item that allows them to do so. Included in the trait will be a description of the materials the creature requires to create the item, as well as a collection of associated [[Threshold Check|Threshold Checks]], usually in Strength or Focus, and an amount of time required. In general, the amount of time and difficulty of checks goes up along with the [[Value]] of the item you are attempting to create. 

To actually craft an item, make the [[Threshold Check|Threshold Checks]] required, adding your [[Crafting Ability]] attribute. If they are all successful, the the item is successfully created after the specified amount of time. If a number of them fail, a corresponding amount of time and materials are lost, generally proportional to the number of checks failed. However, then next time the same craft is attempted, add a +5 modifier to each check for each previous consecutive unsuccessful attempt.
