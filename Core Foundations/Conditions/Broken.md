A [[Creature]] automatically gains this condition if it has a maximum Break endurance greater than zero, but a current Break endurance of 0. 

When you are broken, you are exhausted, and generally display noticeable signs of whatever damage you have taken. While broken, you gain 2 fewer actions at the beginning of your turn.
