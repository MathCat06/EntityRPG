***Types:*** `=this.ConditionTypes`
***Description:***

A [[Creature]] gains this condition when they receive a Fatal [[Wounds|Wound]].

A dead Creature has its Break and Body locked at 0, retains any [[Wounds]] it took in life, cannot take actions or otherwise influence the world unless a rule specifically states it ignores this condition. The creature loses all Temporary [[Conditions]], and cannot activate or use any abilities unless they specifically circumvent Death.
