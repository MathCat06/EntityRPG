Damage is most commonly dealt by weapons in combat, but it has plenty of different sources. Unless otherwise specified, Damage reduces Break Endurance first, then once a target is [[Broken]], the target's Body Endurance (carrying over if it is greater than the Creatures remaining Break). If Damage reduces a Creature's Body endurance to 0, that Creature takes a [[Wounds|Wound]] and restores their Body to its maximum, then carrying over further unmarked damage.

Ways to recover from wounds and damage are introduced in other content sections, but generally it is simple to recover Break Endurance, more difficult to recover Body Endurance, and most difficult to recover Wounds, especially severe ones. [[Death]] is the most difficult of these to overcome.
