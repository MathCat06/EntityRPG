A [[Creature]] dies when it receives a fatal [[Wounds|Wound]], and gains the [[Dead]] condition. It can't take actions or participate further in the game unless another rule specifically states it can. Additionally, a creature dies it its maximum Body Endurance is reduced to 0. In this case, it gains the [[Dead]] condition and receives the [[Drained]] wound.

If the creature was that of a player, and there is little chance of resurrection, this is the point that a player should create a new character, working with the GM to integrate it into the story.
