Many effects require you to Target another [[Entities|Entity]]. For an entity to be targetable, you must see (or otherwise know the location of) the entity. This is implicit to the word target, but can be overridden. If you do not know the exact location, only the general area, of an entity but decide to target it anyway, make a Luck [[Check]] with the difficulty modifier determined by the GM. If you are successful, target as normal. If not, expend all limited resources used to activate the effect, but do not actually apply the effects.
