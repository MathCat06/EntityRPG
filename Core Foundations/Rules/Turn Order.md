When fighting or other fast-paced action is taking place, it may be useful to move into turn order, keeping track of specifically how much each [[Creature]] is able to accomplish. When Turn Order is initiated (whether or not fighting is involved), each Creature involved makes a Dexterity ([[Initiative]]) [[Contested Check]]. Instead of a normal victor, the rankings of creatures determine the order in which they will act. Mark the order in which creatures will take their turns, then begin taking turns, starting with the first.
# Turns
At the beginning of each turn of their turns, a Creature gains 5 Action Points. If they had any Action Points saved from their last turn, they lose half of them, rounded down. While all events in combat happen essentially simultaneously, each Action Point generally represents 2 seconds of action, adding to 10 seconds per round through the initiative order. These Action Points are the main way with which Creatures can interact with the world, and are the main basis of Turn Order. The actual Actions a Creature may take are outlined below. 

After a creature spends their action points, or elects to pass their turn, initiative passes to the next creature, who may then act. If a Creature with initiative points saved wishes to interrupt to take actions, they may do so at any point after the end of a Creature's turn. If they want to fully interrupt another Creature, they must use the React action on their turn. If multiple creatures want to interrupt, the one with the highest initiative acts first. 

Turns continue until the GM deems that the need for fast paced action is over.
# Actions
Below are the actions central to normal turn orders. Each action will have an associated cost, and many other Objects and Traits have associated actions.

**1 Action: Move**
Move a distance up to your Speed. If you are moving directly past a Creature that is hostile to you, you must spend twice the normal amount of movement.

**1 Action: React**
Select an Action and a trigger. You may interrupt another Creature's turn immediately when the trigger occurs, taking the Action you selected as a Reaction instead. This is mostly up to the GM's discretion, but the trigger can generally be any reasonable event the Creature could expect and react to. Pay the costs of your triggered action as normal.

**1 Action: Check**
Take a difficult action, one that would require a check to succeed at. Make a [[Tier Check]] to inspect something, try to recall a piece of knowledge, make a [[Contested Check]] to try to detect a lie or hide from something, or make a [[Threshold Check]] to jump a long distance or push open a jammed door.

**1 Action: Interact**
Interact with a small object, trade an item to someone, toss something away from yourself, etc. If another action specifically refers to an item, you generally don't need to use this one first (drawing a weapon is part of an attack, but switching what weapon you're holding needs an Interact action, for example).

**1 Action: Recover**
Make a Focus check or a Resistance check. If you succeed, you regain 1 Break.
# Reactions
A reaction, as opposed to an action, can be used at any time it's precondition is met. You may only use a reaction once for each time its trigger occurs.
