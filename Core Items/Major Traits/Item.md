***Description:***

This [[Object]] has a Slot type, can be carried by a [[Creature]], and its effects can only be gained if the creature has an unused Slot of matching type. A Creature has 1 Head Slot, 1 Torso Slot, 2 Hand Slots, and 1 Foot Slot to distribute items between. An item with no Slot type can be used at any time. A Creature can carry a maximum of 10 items. If they wish to pick up an item when they already have 10, they must drop one first. Certain Items also have Prerequisites to use, in addition to being a creature.
