[[Core Items/Major Traits/Item|Items]] are a new type of [[Object]] introduced in this content section. They are given [[Value|Values]] just like any other object, but they should be generally correspond to hard difficult the item is to get, whether cost or other methods. They should also be generally transferrable to [[Creature]] value, at a 1 to 1 rate.

Items also get a new type: their slot. A Creature can only use the effects of the item if they have an open slot of matching type. In most settings, a Creature has 1 Head Slot, 1 Torso Slot, 2 Hand Slots, and 1 Foot Slot to distribute items between. An item with no Slot type can be used at any time. A Creature can carry a maximum of 10 items. If they wish to pick up an item when they already have 10, they must drop one first.
