You gain a proficiency in using magic.

You gain the Mana [[Endurances|Endurance]], with a maximum of 5. This tracks the amount of power you have left to cast spells and use magic.

You gain the Magic Surge statistic, starting at 5. This is the total amount of power you can use for a single spell. You may not cast a spell with power higher than this number.

You have a list of prepared spells granted from other Traits. While other spells may be relevant to you, these are the spells you may cast using Mana, and are available to be used for as long as they are prepared.
