***Description:***

The effects of this spell may be continued at an additional cost of 2 actions each turn, as long as concentration is held on it by the caster, with your concentration broken if you are unable or unwilling to pay the action cost at the end of your turn. If the caster has their concentration broken, the effects of the spell are ended and it must be cast again. 

When you receive a wound, if half the severity (rounded down) is less than your Resistance, make a Resistance check. On a failure, you lose concentration on this spell.
