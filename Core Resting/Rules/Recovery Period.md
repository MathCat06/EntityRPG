A Recovery Period is a long amount of time, usually a few days to a few weeks (or even months), depending on the genre and mood of the story, in which the [[Creature|Creatures]] involved can recover from more serious wounds and come back to full strength after a harrowing journey.

Each creature removes all [[Wounds|Wound]] they have with the Temporary or Attrition type. They make a Resistance [[Tier Check]] for their overall recovery. Then, for each of their remaining wounds that could reasonably be recovered from, they roll and sum 2D20. If the result is less than the result of their Tier Check plus the wound's severity, they recover from it. Additionally, some abilities can be used or regained during a recovery period, and usually players will be able to participate in other downtime events.
