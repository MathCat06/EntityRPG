A Recovery Period is a long amount of time, usually a few days to a few weeks (or even months), depending on the genre and mood of the story, in which the [[Creature|Creatures]] involved can recover from more serious wounds and come back to full strength after a harrowing journey.

Each creature removes every [[Wounds|Wound]] they have with the Temporary or Attrition type. They make a Resistance [[Tier Check]] for each wound they have that could reasonably be recovered from. If the severity plus the Tier check is greater than 20, the wound is healed. Additionally, some abilities can be used or regained during a recovery period, and usually players will be able to participate in other downtime events.
