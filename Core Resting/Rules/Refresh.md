A Refresh is a short amount of time, usually a minute to an hour depending on the genre and mood, in which the [[Creature|Creatures]] involved can recover their breath and prepare for their next challenge.

Each creature makes a Resistance [[Check]], recovering all their Break Endurance on a success and half on a failure. Additionally, abilities can often be used or regain their use during a refresh.
