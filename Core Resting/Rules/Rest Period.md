A Rest Period is an intermediate amount, usually an hour to a day depending on the genre and mood, in which the [[Creature|Creatures]] involved begin to heal from wounds taken and bring themselves back to their full effectiveness.

Each creature regains all their Break Endurance, then makes a Resistance [[Check]]. On a success, they regain all their Body Endurance, regaining half on a failure. If appropriate, a creature may also remove their least severe [[Wounds|Wound]] with the Temporary type. Additionally, abilities can often be used or regain their use during a Rest Period.
