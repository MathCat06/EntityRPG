Rest is the main method for [[Creature|Creatures]] to recover from [[Wounds]] and recover their Endurances. Rests can generally be broken into three story forms: [[Refresh|Refreshes]], [[Rest Period|Rest Periods]], and [[Recovery Period|Recovery Periods]], in order of their duration. 

Note that these are all tools for the GM. If the situation doesn't call for it, a Rest is not required to be given. For example, a refresh doesn't have to be given after an encounter if the players had one just before. It all depends on the game you want to play, however.
