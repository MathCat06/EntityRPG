A Check is used by the GM whenever their is an uncertain outcome in an [[Entities|Entity]]'s actions. There are two main types, the [[Threshold Check]], the more common of the two, and the [[Contested Check]]. Generally, if the outcome of something is deemed to be impossible by the GM, a check is not used. Likewise, if there is no chance that a given entity would fail at the task in question, a check is not used.

When laying out a check, rules will use the following format: "Make a Score (Attribute)" check.
