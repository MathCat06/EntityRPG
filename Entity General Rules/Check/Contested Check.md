A Contested Check is an alternative type of [[Check]], called for when two entities come into direct conflict with each other (one struggling to grapple the other, both attempting to outdebate each other, sprint to a location the fastest, etc.).

To perform a Contested Check, the GM determines which [[Scores]] and [[Attributes]] are relevant for each entity (they are often the same, but don't have to be - a creatures lying and trying to discern lies are doing very different things). 

Then, each entity rolls 2D20, subtracts their relevant Score, and adds any relevant modifiers from Attributes or other sources. The entity with the higher result wins the Check, with the results narrated by the GM. In the event of a tie in total, the entity with the lower applicable score wins.

If the GM decides it is applicable, there may be Group Contested Checks. Perform the same process as above, adding and comparing the totals for each side of the contest, determining the victorious side. This is also useful as a larger-scale narrative device, speeding up the resolution of a chase or massive battle, for example.
