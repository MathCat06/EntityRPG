The most common type of [[Check]], based primarily on an entity's [[Scores]], is the Threshold Check. When a player wants to attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the GM may call for a Threshold Check. Rules call for a threshold check like so: "Make a Strength (+1) Check"

To perform a Threshold Check, the GM determines what Score is relevant, as well as whether a specific [[Attributes|Attribute]] is applicable. In addition, they decide on a difficulty modifier to add, based on the difficulty of the task being attempted (negative modifiers if the task is more difficult, positive if it is easier). A modifier of -10 makes a task hard, -20 makes it extremely difficult, and a -30 will usually make it impossible, with the reciprocals being true for positive modifiers.

Then, the player rolls 2D20, and adds their totals together, along with the difficulty modifier and any relevant attribute modifiers. If the total is at or above the player's Score, they succeed. Otherwise, they fail. If the threshold is exceeded by 10 or more, the result is a critical success, potentially providing additional benefits. If the threshold is missed by 10 or more, the result is a critical failure, with the opposite effect. In any result, the consequences are then narrated, using these rules for reference if desired.

Not that if multiple characters want to attempt the same task, they may, at the GM's discretion. Alternatively, you may elect to ramp difficulty for subsequent attempts, with an additional -5 modifier added on for each attempt.
