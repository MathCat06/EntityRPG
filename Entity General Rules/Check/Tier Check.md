A Tier Check is used for open ended outcomes, where there are multiple levels of success. It is the most story defined type of [[Check]], and is rarely used in specific mechanics. Examples include searching a room, creating an art piece, or trying to find general information.

Follow essentially the same process as a [[Threshold Check]], adding Attribute, and other modifiers to the sum of 2D20 (Tier Checks don't have difficulty). Then, subtract your relevant score, leaving a number total (higher is better). Generally, +10 is good, +20 is amazing, and +30 is legendary. The results of this type of check are entirely up to the GM. Rules call for a Tier check like so: "Make a Strength (Core) Tier Check".

If multiple players want to attempt the same thing, they may each make their own check, adding the totals together. The GM then interprets the result as before, keeping in mind the possibility for higher scores.
