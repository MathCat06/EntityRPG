Attributes represent specific skills an [[Entities|Entity]] may have, signifying their ability with a modifier. This modifier can be positive or negative, and is generally somewhere between +10 and -10. Running, history, and the ability to carve wood are all good examples of an Attribute. Notably, each Attribute is associated with one or more specific [[Scores]] - for example, running would be aligned with strength, history with mental ability, and wood carving with focus or dexterity. The only mechanical purpose of this association is in prerequisites for [[Traits]], but it also functions as a suggestion for what Score should be used in a specific [[Check]]. If an Entity doesn't have an Attribute value for something, it is assumed to be a 0.

Attributes are also assigned levels in order of importance. Lower values are more important.

See Content Sections for specific Attributes and their uses.
