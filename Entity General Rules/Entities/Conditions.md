Conditions are (sometimes) temporary effects that can be applied to [[Entities]]. A condition can have its own conditions for when an Entity gains or loses that condition, and can also be given by other rules. A condition with the Temporary Type can remove itself from an Entity, while others will require external actions. A Condition is also usually has a Type corresponding to what entity or entities it can be applied to.
