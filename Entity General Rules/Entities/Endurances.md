Endurances are representative of an [[Entities|Entity]]'s state of health. The maximum of Endurances are variable, but higher is always better. For each endurance, an entity has a current and a maximum amount. Usually, bad things happen when the current amount hits 0. The two most standard are Focus and Body, but others can easily be added where relevant (mental state or contamination level are two common examples). If an Entity does not have and Endurance and one is referenced, assume their current and maximum amounts are both 0. Note, however that this does not have any effect on the entity by itself, this is only for reference from other effects.

See Content Sections for specific Endurances and their uses.
