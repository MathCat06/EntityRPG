Every creature, enemy, player character, robot, or even object, is represented by the same basic properties. Depending on the setting, these can be modified using [[Foundation Traits]] to add other important pieces, so they will be broken down into major types of statistic. An entity is generally represented by an [[Entity Cards|Entity Card]], which will contain the following
- **[[Scores]]** represent the main things an entity is capable of. Physical strength, endurance, mental acuity, and charisma are all good examples of a trait. The scores themselves are out of 40, with lower numbers being better.
- **[[Attributes]]** represent specific skills an entity may have, signifying their ability with a modifier. Running, history, and the ability to carve wood are all good examples. Each attribute is associated with one or more specific traits - for example, running is aligned with strength, history with mental ability, and wood carving with focus or dexterity.
- **[[Endurances]]** are representative of an entity's state of health. The two most standard are focus and body, but others can easily be added where relevant (mental state or contamination level are two common examples)
- [[Traits]] are the main organizational and mechanical unit of Threshold, used for abilities and classification (see below).
- Statistics are useful, especially for objects, for keeping track of hard in-story info such as Weight, Size, Cost, etc. Speed of creatures is also tracked here. [[Value]] is especially important as a meta-statistic of a sort; it keeps track of general mechanical strength of entities, usually by adding up the Values of their Traits. This is useful to determine what enemies are relevant to the current collection of player characters.
- Tags have no inherent purpose, but are sometimes referenced for other rules
- Descriptions are included in almost every entity, detailing what the rest of these options cannot.
# Traits
[[Traits]] are the main foundation of customization in Threshold. [[Foundation Traits]] define the main functions, type, and setting specific statistics of an entity, while [[Major Traits]] provide wide direction, with [[Minor Traits]] providing the finest detail customization, generally detailing specific abilities and capabilities of an entity. Prerequisites for traits are the main structure of actual progression for players, and their value rankings allow fine tuned balancing across the whole of a story.
# Creating Entities
In general, Entity creation is done by selecting traits and modifying the contents of an [[Entity Cards|Entity Card]] accordingly. Usually one starts by choosing Foundation Traits, then Major, then finally Minor Traits to finish the Entity. Note that you can always create a trait of your own if you don't see the option you're looking for. Keep in mind that however you do it, you will want to use the Entity's Value to make sure it's relevant to where your player's are in the game. See content sections for descriptions of how to create their types of entities. See [[Creating Traits]] for details, tips, and style information on how to create and balance general Traits.
