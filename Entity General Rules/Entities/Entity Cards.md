Entity Cards are easy to use representations of an [[Entities|Entity]] in the game. They include the relevant [[Scores]], [[Attributes]], [[Endurances]], Statistics, and [[Traits]], as well as the necessary info for quick reference during gameplay. See the [[Entity_Template]] page for an empty example. If printing out cards, the traits themselves would generally have separate reference.
