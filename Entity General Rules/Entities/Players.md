What a player controls is dependent on how the GM wants to run the game. In general, however, each player controls a single [[Entities|Entity]], which they make all relevant decisions for. Further, the total [[Value]] controlled by each non-GM player should be similar. It doesn't have to be identical, but unless the game you want to play is intentionally asymmetrical, having a comparable total value of controlled entities gives each player similar mechanical control over the game.

After selecting [[Content Sections]] for a game, you should select a starting Value for players and create their entities. The details of this process will generally be described in more specific Content Sections, but it will generally consist of selecting Traits from a starting Trait configuration until the value each player controls is up to, but not exceeding, their value total.
