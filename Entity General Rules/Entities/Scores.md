A Score is a number between 0 and 40  representing the skill of an [[Entities|Entity]] in a certain area. 20 is the standard starting amount for any given score, and a lower number is better. They are primarily used in [[Check|Checks]] for determining the outcome of an Entity's actions. If an Entity doesn't have a score and needs one, it is assumed to have a 40.

See Content Sections for specific Scores and their uses.
