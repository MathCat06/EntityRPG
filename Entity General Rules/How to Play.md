The game of Entity is generally run by a game master, who controls both the beings other then the players, and the world itself. They are the main author of the story as well, with the players taking the roles of the main characters. Generally play will proceed with players deciding on actions, then the GM describing the consequences, then the players taking more actions, etc. There are many resources available about how to do this well, se them for further reference, as this is the hardest part about playing. The main purpose of these rules is to introduce chance and the opportunity for constraints on that collective storytelling. All rules are optional if they don't work for your group, and this is designed in such a way as to still function with most of the core rules removed - This page is essentially all that is needed for a game.

Almost every challenge in a story is represented through threshold checks, based on an entity's [[Scores]]. When a player wants to attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the GM may call for a [[Threshold Check]]. When two entities are in direct conflict (struggling against each other, racing to react first, trying to outperform each other, etc.), a [[Contested Check]] may be called instead. 

Note that for resolving abilities, [[Traits]] override general rules, conditions and other temporary effects override traits. Additionally, "Can" is overridden by "can't", unless explicitly stated.
# Starting a Game
To start, all that is needed is players, dice, these rules, and an idea of what sort of game you want to play. Based on that, select relevant [[Content Sections]] to use, make your characters, and begin the game. The basics of how to set up what players control is explained under [[Players]], who always control [[Entities]].

As to content sections, they contain the more detailed rules on how to play, and are the main drivers of different genres. Once these are selected, they should generally only be added to, not removed, and the different contents can be safely combined into large pools. For a game that is similar to D&D and other fantasy games, the [[Core Foundations Overview|Core Foundations]], [[Core Adventure Overview|Core Adventure]], and [[Core Combat Overview|Core Combat]] content sets should be used, with a genre specific content set to provide appropriate character and enemy options. This system, though, is built to accommodate much more.

It is also generally good form as a GM to hold a Session 0, going over the content sections in use and how character creation will function.
