[[Traits]] are the core of all abilities and usages of [[Entities]] in Entity. Therefore, they are in many ways the most important aspect of the game. The three different types of Trait, however, should be used very differently. Note that this isn't a hard and fast rule: Except for Foundation Prerequisites, the different types of traits are treated identically. This is simply the "official" method for separating Traits into major categories.
# Foundation Traits
See the [[Foundation Traits]] page for an in depth explanation of these traits. Generally, Entities with the same set of Foundation Traits can be compared relatively directly, while those with different Foundation Traits cannot. Think trying to compare a planet with a person. While both may have Scores and Statistics that work in similar ways, mechanics wise, they are not at all similar. As such, Foundation Traits have no Prerequisites: They are the most important prerequisite for other traits. Foundation traits don't generally need balancing; they can be, however, in certain cases. For example, if you want spaceships to have similar effects on the world as aliens, just at a different but comparable scale. Foundation traits give Entities their most universal Scores, Endurances, and Statistics.
# Major Traits
See the [[Major Traits]] page for an in depth explanation of these traits. Generally, Major Traits outline the main usage, in game, of an Entity. This corresponds to Wizards, Weapons, and Vehicles. Major traits generally have out-of-trait rules associated with them, and provide the main in game distinctions between similar Entities. Again, Major Traits usually don't use [[Value]], though if adding a Major Trait provides a substantial mechanical benefit compared to other Entities with the same Foundation Traits, it should have an appropriate Value, as described below.
# Minor Traits
While Foundation and Major Traits should generally prioritize flavor and representation of what they are used for, Minor Traits are used for the detailed abilities and mechanics that make a difference in gameplay. This is where you can truly go wild to represent any action and potential within your game's world.

These traits are also where different Values are most necessary; when a GM is determining what enemies or obstacles their players could successfully face, having a relatively accurate means of comparison is extremely helpful (CR, I'm looking at you). Trait values should primarily determined through experimentation and revision, or simply through comparison with other similar mechanics after you're familiar with the ruleset you're using; this isn't meant as an exact one-to-one comparison. 

Possibly the most important situation for balance is when designing Traits that players will get to use. Even if the game is difficult for the player characters, the ability to keep all characters on a level playing field does wonders for teamwork. Keep in mind as well which traits will interact with each other; a very restricted trait that can't synergize with anything else should have that considered, even if its base effect is very powerful. Keep in mind that everything in this game should be somewhat flexible, so if a trait becomes a problem, adjusting or removing it is always within the GM's purview.
