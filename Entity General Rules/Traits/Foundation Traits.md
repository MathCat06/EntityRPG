Foundation Traits are a type of [[Traits|Trait]] that defines the main functions, type, and setting specific statistics of an [[Entities|Entity]].

The most commonly used Foundation Traits are for objects and creatures, while [[Major Traits]] generally make the distinctions between monsters, intelligent beings, vehicles, magic items, etc. Additionally, Foundation traits generally have a [[Value]] of 0; things with different Foundation traits generally shouldn't be mechanically comparable to each other.

Different Foundation Traits are for fundamentally different things, which often require their own rules to use. Gods would be a good example of another type of Foundation trait; They could conceivably have relevant statistics, but those are significantly different from what is needed to represent a mortal.

Foundation traits are also good for adding setting-wide mechanics. If radiation is prevalent in the setting, then adding a radiation Endurance is useful. Foundation Traits are also useful for emphasizing different themes in a setting. They essentially provide the main structure for how your version of the game plays, and different variations work for different things.
