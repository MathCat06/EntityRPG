Major Traits provide a wide direction, for an [[Entities|Entity]]. Major Traits, for a creature, will usually determine race, whether it is sentient, occupation, innate supernatural or technological abilities, etc. For an object, this could determine whether it is a weapon, whether it is magical, whether it's a vehicle, etc. Often, a Major Trait will also provide some number of [[Minor Traits]]. If this is the case, the [[Value|Values]] of the Minor Traits are included in the Value of the Major Trait.

Major Traits, in addition to having a Value and Type, also have Prerequisites, which are traits or characteristics an Entity must have in order to make use of the Trait.

Major Traits are also (in theory) all open to the players for character creation. However, the GM should always be consulted if a Major Trait is going to be added or removed from a player character; this is almost always a major event in the character's life.

Certain Major Traits also function as prerequisites to large numbers of Minor Traits. The best example of this is the main "class system" of Threshold - choosing starting Major Traits is the main determiner of later progression for player characters.

See Content Sections for specific Major Traits and their uses.
