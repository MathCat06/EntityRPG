Minor Traits provide the finest level of detail customization, generally detailing specific abilities and capabilities of an [[Entities|Entity]]. They are often granted by [[Major Traits]], and often have difficult  prerequisites. Note that some Minor Traits give collections of other Minor Traits. If this is the case, the the total [[Value]] of the given traits is included in the first.

Major Traits, in addition to having a Value and Type, also have Prerequisites, which are traits or characteristics an Entity must have in order to make use of the Trait.

Minor Traits, in addition to granting abilities, are the primary way to increase (or decrease) [[Scores]],[[Attributes]], and sometimes [[Endurances]]. They are also the most complex thing to keep track of during gameplay, so make sure you and your players are familiar with all Traits relevant to the character they're playing.

See Content Sections for specific Minor Traits and their uses.
