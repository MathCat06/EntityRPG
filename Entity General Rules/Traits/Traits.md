[[Traits]] are the main foundation of customization in Entity, and provide all the information necessary to differentiate different [[Entities]]. Every Trait also has a [[Value]], signifying the mechanical strength it provides. When a trait is added or removed from an Entity, always update the Entity's Value according to the Trait's Value. Every Trait also can have one or more Types. This determines whether it is a Foundation, Major, or Minor trait, and is occasionally used for other mechanics, though it is mostly useful for player organization. Note that Traits with the "Base" type generally don't need to be kept track of individually; They modify only base statistics of an entity, so tracking that statistic is enough.

Note that with the exception of Base traits and other explicit exceptions, each Entity can only take each trait once.

[[Foundation Traits]] define the main functions, type, and setting specific statistics of an Entity, including whether it is an object, creature, or something else. Foundation Traits also may provide Major or Minor Traits.
[[Major Traits]] provide wide direction, determining, for example, whether a creature is a soldier, spellcaster, mutant, its race or origin, etc. Major Traits may also provide, included within them, Minor Traits. 
[[Minor Traits]] providing the finest detail customization, generally detailing specific abilities and capabilities of an Entity. 

Prerequisites for Traits are the main structure of  progression for players, creating a skill tree like structure, and their Value rankings allow fine tuned balancing across the whole of a story. If an Entity is not able to meet the prerequisites of one of its traits, the GM determines what happens; usually, the effects of that trait will simply not apply until its prerequisites are once again met. If a trait would be permanently disabled in this way, remove the trait and adjust the entity's Value calculation accordingly.
