Traits with the Archetype trait are designed in much the same way that player Classes or Archetypes are set up in other games. Each Archetype has its own strengths and primary abilities, making each into a distinct experience. Choosing archetype doesn't lock you into one line of upgrades, however. Archetypes function more as classifications and structures for other abilities.
