When creating a Character's [[Creature]] with Gauntlet, the first thing to know is how powerful that creature will be. Higher [[Value|Values]] provide more options and customization, but are also much more complex to build and play. Additionally, this value can be spread across different categories.

The recommended starting configuration for new players is as follows, for a total 80 Value per Creature:
- 30 Value worth of the following traits (this means a net 15 point gain)
	- [[Score Upgrade]]
	- [[Score Downgrade]]
- 5 Value worth of the following traits
	- [[Attribute Upgrade]]
	- [[Attribute Downgrade]]
- 15 Value worth of the following traits
	- [[Speed Upgrade]] (a speed of 3 meters is relatively standard and costs 8 Value)
	- [[Body Upgrade]]
	- [[Break Upgrade]]
- 10 Value worth of one [[Archetype Traits|Archetype Trait]] and other Traits with it as a prerequisite.
- 10 Value worth of miscellaneous Traits, or [[Item|Items]] if using the [[Core Items Overview|Core Items]] content section..
Any of these, of course, are up to the GM's discretion. Note that personality, appearance, etc. can be more important than these aspects, depending on the game, so make sure to put effort into that aspect of play as well.

Throughout play, as players gain familiarity with how to use their Characters, they can gain more Value to distribute between traits. see [[Gauntlet Progression]] for more details.
