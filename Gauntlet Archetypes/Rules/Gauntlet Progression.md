As Players gain familiarity with the rules relevant to them, and as their characters grow in power narratively, their mechanical strength, and therefore [[Value]] should most likely grow as well. A standard way to do this is to provide each player with a certain amount of value to spend or save at the end of each session: 2-5 is a relatively normal amount. Whenever they like, they may spend their Value to gain Traits they have the prerequisites for. Note that these should almost always be [[Minor Traits]], and further, ones without the Base type, though the [[Score Upgrade]] and [[Attribute Upgrade]]  traits are exceptions to this. 

Note that [[Item|Items]] throw off this balance, if using the [[Core Items Overview|Core Items]] content section. This can be addressed in one of a few ways; either the imbalance is ignored, allowing the players to sort items amongst themselves, (this requires a balanced array of items), or players with a lower value gain value more quickly. Alternatively, if you allow players to select items for themselves, they can spend their own value on items.
