EntityRPG  is intended to be a flexible, in depth, mechanically rich, expandable RPG system. The intention is to easily be able to expand and use almost any mechanic you want, for any setting you want. The core rules are more of a suggestion, and should be adjusted if balance is off. As such, the rules are broken into [[Content Sections]], each of which will have an overview.

While this set of rules is made up of markdown files, it is primarily intended to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). To set it up, download these files and open them as a vault in Obsidian, or alternatively, use [this link](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started) to clone this repository into an existing obsidian vault. Additionally used are the Git, Dataview, Folder Notes, and Better Word Count plugins.
